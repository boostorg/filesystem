[section:install Installing and using the library]

[section:platform_requirements Supported compilers and platforms]

The library requires a C++11 compiler as a minimum and is regularly tested with the following
compilers:

* GCC 4.8 and newer on Linux.
* Clang 3.5 and newer with libstdc++ and libc++ on Linux.
* Apple Clang 13 on Mac OS.
* MSVC 14.0 and newer on Windows.
* Clang-cl 16.0.6 on Windows.
* MinGW-w64 with GCC 8 and newer on Windows.
* GCC 7 on Cygwin and Cygwin64.

The library supports POSIX systems and Windows 10 and newer. Note that many operating systems
not normally thought of as POSIX systems, such as mainframe legacy operating systems or
embedded operating systems, support POSIX compatible file systems and so will work with
the Filesystem Library.

Besides the operating systems mentioned above, the library has been used on HP-UX, IBM AIX,
SGI IRIX, OpenBSD, FreeBSD and Sun Solaris operating systems using a variety of compilers.
It is also used by several smart phone operating systems.

[section:cygwin_notes Notes for Cygwin users]

[@https://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin] version 1.7 or later is required because
only versions of GCC with wide character strings are supported.

The library's implementation code treats Cygwin as a POSIX platform, and
thus uses the POSIX API and path syntax as the native path syntax.

[section:building Building the library]

Boost.Filesystem is implemented as a separately compiled library, so you must install
binaries in a location that can be found by your linker. If you followed the
[@https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/more/getting_started/index.html Boost Getting Started]
instructions, that's already been done for you.

Otherwise, the library can also be built manually using __boost_build__ or CMake using the project
files in the library directory. For example, using __boost_build__ one can build a release version
of the library with the following command line in the Boost root directory:

[pre
b2 --with-filesystem variant=release stage
]

With CMake, the library can be built with the following commands, also in the Boost root directory:

[pre
mkdir build_static_release
cd build_static_release
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBOOST_INCLUDE_LIBRARIES=filesystem
cmake --build .
]

The library can be built for static or dynamic (shared/dll) linking. For Boost.Build,
this is controlled with the `link` [@https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/tools/build/doc/html/index.html#bbv2.overview.builtins.features
property] which can have values `shared` and `static`. For example, to build shared
libraries:

[pre
b2 --with-filesystem variant=release link=shared stage
]

For CMake, the `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` option enables building shared libraries. Note that
with CMake users typically have to create a separate build directory for every
build configuration.

[pre
mkdir build_shared_release
cd build_shared_release
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=1 -DBOOST_INCLUDE_LIBRARIES=filesystem
cmake --build .
]

When using Boost.Filesystem as a shared library, users should define `BOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK` or
`BOOST_FILESYSTEM_DYN_LINK` macros when compiling their code. This will configure the auto-linking
process to link with the shared library instead of the static one. See the
[@https://www.boost.org/development/separate_compilation.html Separate Compilation] page for more details.

[section:config_macros Configuration Macros]

Users may define the following macros if desired. Sensible defaults are
provided, so users can ignore these macros unless they have special needs.

Some of the macros can be defined when compiling user's code, which will affect library interfaces.
Other macros can be defined during Boost.Filesystem compilation, which affect library implementation.
Those macros need not be defined when building code that uses Boost.Filesystem.

[table

[
    [`BOOST_FILESYSTEM_VERSION`]
    [3]
    [\u2714][]

    Defining to 4 also implies `BOOST_FILESYSTEM_NO_DEPRECATED`.]

    The `copy_file_range` system call was introduced in Linux kernel 4.5 and started operating across filesystems in 5.3.]

    [`BOOST_FILESYSTEM_DISABLE_ARC4RANDOM`]
    [Not defined. `arc4random` API presence detected at library build time.]
    [][\u2714]
    [Boost.Filesystem library does not use the `arc4random_buf` system call on BSD systems.
    The `arc4random` API was introduced in OpenBSD 2.1 and FreeBSD 8.0.]
]
[
    [`BOOST_FILESYSTEM_DISABLE_BCRYPT`]
    [Not defined. BCrypt API presence detected at library build time.]
    [][\u2714]
    [Boost.Filesystem library does not use the BCrypt API on Windows. Has no effect on other platforms.]
]
]

In order to define macros when building Boost.Filesystem one can use `define` property with
Boost.Build or `-D` option with CMake. For example:

[pre
b2 --with-filesystem variant=release define=BOOST_FILESYSTEM_DISABLE_STATX stage
]

or:

[pre
mkdir build_static_release
cd build_static_release
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBOOST_INCLUDE_LIBRARIES=filesystem -DBOOST_FILESYSTEM_DISABLE_STATX
cmake --build .
]

For new code using Boost.Filesystem, defining `BOOST_FILESYSTEM_NO_DEPRECATED` before including
filesystem headers is strongly recommended. This prevents inadvertent use of old features,
particularly legacy function names, that have been replaced and are going to go away in the future.

[endsect]

[section:headers Headers and namespaces]

Library components can be introduced by including one of the headers in the `boost/filesystem`
directory or `boost/filesystem.hpp`, which includes all headers in `boost/filesystem`.

Library components are defined in the `boost::filesystem` namespace.

Do not include headers from `boost/filesystem/detail` directory or use symbols from
the `boost::filesystem::detail` namespace. Those are implementation details of the library,
they are not part of the public interface and may be changed or removed without notice.
