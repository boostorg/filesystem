<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Boost Filesystem Library provides portable facilities to query and 
manipulate paths, files, and directories.</p>

<p>The motivation for the library is the need to perform portable script-like operations from within C++ programs. The intent is not to 
compete with Python, Perl, or shell languages, but rather to provide portable filesystem 
operations when C++ is already the language of choice. The <a href="design.htm">
design</a> encourages, but does not require, safe and portable  usage.</p>

<p>Programs using the library are <b><i>portable</i></b>, both in the sense that 
the syntax of program code is portable, and the sense that the semantics or 
behavior of code is portable. The <a href="path.htm#Grammar">generic path 
grammar</a> is another important aid to portability.</p>

<p>Usage is <i><b>safe</b></i> in the sense that most functions throw C++ 
exceptions when errors are detected, avoiding the need to explicitly check error 
return codes.</p>

<p>The Filesystem Library supplies several&nbsp; headers, all in 
directory boost/filesystem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Header <i><a href="../../../boost/filesystem/path.hpp">path.hpp</a></i> provides class <i>
  basic_path, </i>a portable mechanism for representing
      <a href="#path">paths</a> in C++ programs. Typedefs <i>path</i> and <i>
  wpath</i> ease the most common usages of <i>basic_path</i>. Supporting classes 
  and validity checking 
      functions are also provided. See <a href="path.htm">path.hpp documentation</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Header <i><a href="../../../boost/filesystem/operations.hpp">operations.hpp</a></i> provides functions operating on files and directories, 
  and includes class <i>basic_directory_iterator</i> with typdefs <i>
  directory_iterator</i> and <i>wdirectory_iterator</i>. See <a href="operations.htm">
  operations.hpp documentation</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Header <i><a href="../../../boost/filesystem/fstream.hpp">fstream.hpp</a></i> provides the same components as the C++ Standard 
  Library's <i>fstream</i> header, except 
      that files are identified by <i>basic_path</i> objects rather that <i>char *</i>'s. 
  See <a href="fstream.htm">fstream.hpp documentation</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Header <a href="../../../boost/filesystem/convenience.hpp">convenience.hpp</a> 
  provides convenience functions that combine lower-level functions in useful 
  ways. See <a href="convenience.htm">convenience.hpp documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The organizing principle is that purely lexical operations on<i> </i>
      <a href="#path">paths</a> are supplied as class<i> basic_path</i> member 
functions in <i>path.hpp</i>, while operations performed by the operating system 
on the actual external filesystem directories and files are provided in <i>
operations.hpp,</i> primarily as free functions.</p>
<h2>Two-minute <a name="tutorial">tutorial</a></h2>
<p>First some preliminaries:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>#include &quot;boost/filesystem/operations.hpp&quot; // includes boost/filesystem/path.hpp
#include &quot;boost/filesystem/fstream.hpp&quot;    // ditto
#include &lt;iostream&gt;                        // for std::cout
using boost::filesystem;                   // for ease of tutorial presentation;
                                           // a namespace alias is preferred in real code</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="path.htm#synopsis">class <i>path</i></a> object can be created:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>path my_path( &quot;some_dir/file.txt&quot; );</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The string passed to the <i>path</i> constructor may be in a
<a href="path.htm#Grammar">portable generic path format</a> or an 
implementation-defined native operating system format. Access functions 
make <i>my_path</i> contents available to the underlying operating system API in an operating system dependent format, 
such as <code>&quot;some_dir:file.txt&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;[some_dir]file.txt&quot;</code>,
<code>&quot;some_dir/file.txt&quot;</code>, or whatever is appropriate for the  
operating system. If class <i>wpath</i> is used instead of class <i>path</i>, 
translation between wide and narrow character paths is performed automatically.</p>
<p>Class <i>path</i> has conversion constructors from <i>const char*</i> and <i>
const std:: string&amp;</i>, so that even though the Filesystem Library functions in 
the following code snippet take <i>const path&amp;</i> arguments, the user can just 
code C-style strings:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>remove_all( &quot;foobar&quot; );
create_directory( &quot;foobar&quot; );
ofstream file( &quot;foobar/cheeze&quot; );
file &lt;&lt; &quot;tastes good!\n&quot;;
file.close();
if ( !exists( &quot;foobar/cheeze&quot; ) )
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Something is rotten in foobar\n&quot;;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To make class <i>path</i> objects easy to use in expressions, <i>operator/</i> 
appends paths:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>ifstream file1( arg_path / &quot;foo/bar&quot; );
ifstream file2( arg_path / &quot;foo&quot; / &quot;bar&quot; );</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The expressions <i>arg_path / &quot;foo/bar&quot;</i> and <i>arg_path / &quot;foo&quot; 
/ &quot;bar&quot;</i> yield identical results.</p>
<p>Paths can include references to the parent directory, using the &quot;<code>..</code>&quot; 
notation.</p>
<p><a href="operations.htm#directory_iterator">Class <i>basic_directory_iterator</i></a> 
is an important component of the library. It provides an input iterator over the 
contents of a directory, with the value type being class <i>basic_path</i>. </p>
<p>The following function, given a directory path and a file name, recursively 
searches the directory and its sub-directories for the file name, returning a 
bool, and if successful, the path to the file that was found.&nbsp; The code 
below is extracted from a real program, slightly modified for clarity:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>bool find_file( const path &amp; dir_path,     // in this directory,
                const std::string &amp; file_name, // search for this name,
                path &amp; path_found )        // placing path here if found
{
  if ( !exists( dir_path ) ) return false;
  directory_iterator end_itr; // default construction yields past-the-end
  for ( directory_iterator itr( dir_path );
        itr != end_itr;
        ++itr )
  {
    if ( is_directory( *itr ) )
    {
      if ( find_file( *itr, file_name, path_found ) ) return true;
    }
    else if ( itr-&gt;leaf() == file_name ) // see below
    {
      path_found = *itr;
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The expression <i>itr-&gt;leaf() == file_name</i>, in the line commented <i>// 
see below</i>, calls the <i>leaf()</i> function on the <i>path</i> object 
returned by the iterator. <i>leaf()</i> returns a string which is a copy of the 
last (closest to the leaf, farthest from the root) file or directory name in the
<i>path</i> object.</p>
<p>In addition to <i>leaf()</i>, several other function names use the 
tree/root/branch/leaf metaphor.</p>
<p>Notice that <i>find_file()</i> does not do explicit error checking, such as 
verifying that the <i>dir_path</i> argument really represents a directory.  
Filesystem Library functions throw 
exceptions if they do not complete successfully, so there is enough implicit 
error checking that this application doesn't need to supply additional error 
checking code.</p>
<p>The tutorial is now over; hopefully you now are ready to write simple, 
script-like programs using the Filesystem Library!</p>
<h2><a name="Examples">Examples</a></h2>
<h3>simple_ls.cpp</h3>
<p>The example program <a href="../example/simple_ls.cpp">simple_ls.cpp</a> is 
given a path as a command line argument. Since the command line argument may be 
a relative path, the complete path is determined so that messages displayed 
can be more precise.</p>
<p>The program checks to see if the path exists; if not a message is printed.</p>
<p>If the path identifies a directory, the directory is iterated through, 
printing the name of the entries found, and an indication if they are 
directories. A count of directories and files is updated, and then printed after 
the iteration is complete.</p>
<p>If the path is for a file, a message indicating that is printed.</p>
<p>Try compiling and executing <a href="../example/simple_ls.cpp">simple_ls.cpp</a> 
to see how it works on your system. Try various path arguments to see what 
happens.</p>
<h3>Other examples</h3>
<p>The programs used to generate the Boost regression test status tables use the 
Filesystem Library extensively.&nbsp; See:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../../../tools/regression/process_jam_log.cpp">
  process_jam_log.cpp</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../../tools/regression/compiler_status.cpp">
  compiler_status.cpp</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Test programs are sometimes useful in understanding a library, as they 
illustrate what the developer expected to work and not work. See:</p>

<h2><a name="Definitions">Definitions</a></h2>
<p><b><a name="directory">directory</a> </b>- A container provided by the operating system, 
containing the names of files, other directories, or both. Directories are identified 
by <a href="#directory path">directory path</a>.</p>
<p><b><a name="directory_tree">directory tree</a></b> - A directory and file 
hierarchy viewed as an acyclic graph. The tree metaphor is reflected in the 
root/branch/leaf naming convention for many <a href="#path">path</a> related 
functions.</p>
<p><b><a name="path">path</a> </b>- A possibly empty sequence of <a href="#name">names</a>. Each 
element in the sequence, except the last, names a <a href="#directory">directory</a> 
which contains the 
next element. The last element may name either a directory or file. The first 
element is closest to the <a href="#root">root</a> of the directory tree, the last element is 
farthest from the root.</p>
<p>It is traditional to represent a path as a string, where each element in the 
path is represented by a <a href="#name">name</a>, and some operating system 
defined syntax distinguishes between the name elements. Other representations of 
a path are possible, such as each name being an element in a <code>std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><b><a name="file path">file path</a></b> - A <a href="#path">path</a> whose 
last element is a file.</p>
<p><b><a name="directory_path">directory path</a></b> - A <a href="#path">path</a> 
whose last element is a directory.</p>
<p><b><a name="complete_path">complete path</a></b> - A <a href="#path">path</a> 
which contains all the elements required by the operating system to uniquely 
identify a file or directory. (There is an odd
<a href="path.htm#is_complete_note">corner case</a> where a complete path can 
still be ambiguous on a few operating systems.)</p>
<p><b><a name="relative_path">relative path</a></b> - A <a href="#root">path</a> 
which is not <a href="#complete_path">complete</a>. Before actual use, relative 
paths are turned into <a href="#complete_path">complete paths</a> either 
implicitly by the filesystem adding default elements, or explicitly by the 
program adding the missing elements via function call. Use of relative paths 
often makes a program much more flexible.</p>
<p><b><a name="name">name</a></b> - A file or directory name, without any
<a href="#directory path">directory path</a> information to indicate the file or 
directory's actual location within a directory tree. For some 
operating systems, files and directories may have more than one valid name, such 
as a short-form name and a long-form name.</p>
<p><b><a name="root">root</a></b> - The initial node in the acyclic graph which 
represents the <a href="#directory_path">directory tree</a> for a filesystem.</p>
<p><b><a name="multi-root_filesystem">multi-root operating system</a></b> - An 
operating system which has multiple <a href="#root">roots</a>. Some operating systems 
have different <a href="#directory_tree">directory trees</a> for each different 
disk, drive, device, volume, network share, or other entity managed the system, with each having its 
own root-name.</p>
<p><b><a name="link">link</a></b> - A&nbsp;name in a <a href="#directory">
directory</a> can be viewed as a pointer to some underlying directory or file 
content. Modern operating systems permit multiple directory elements to point to 
the same underlying directory or file content. Such a pointer is often called a 
link. Not all operating systems support the 
concept of links. Links may be reference-counted (<a href="#hard-link">hard link</a>) 
or non-reference-counted (<a href="#symbolic-link">symbolic link</a>).</p>
<p><b><a name="hard-link">hard link</a></b> - A reference-counted
<a href="#link">link</a>. Because the operating system manages the underlying 
file or directory, hard links are transparent to programs. They &quot;just work&quot; 
without the programmer needing to be aware of their existence.</p>
<p><b><a name="symbolic-link">symbolic link</a></b> - A non-reference-counted
<a href="#hard-link">link</a>. The operating system manages some aspects of 
symbolic links. Most uses, such as opening or querying files, automatically 
resolve to the file or directory being pointed to rather than to the symbolic 
link itself. A few uses, such as remove() and rename(), modify the symbolic link 
rather than it's target. See an important
<a href="operations.htm#symbolic-link-warning">symbolic links warning</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="Common_Specifications">Common Specifications</a></h2>
<p>Portions of the Boost.Filesystem specifications are defined by reference to 
the <a href="design.htm#POSIX-01">[POSIX-01]</a> standard. How such 
functionality is actually implemented is unspecified. In other words, an &quot;as if&quot; 
rule applies to the actual implementation.</p>
<p><b>Rationale:</b> Reference to <a href="design.htm#POSIX-01">[POSIX-01]</a> 
allows precise semantics based on a joint ISO and IEEE standard that is widely 
implemented and has been proven and refined during many years of existing 
practice. Operating-system wars neutrality is preserved by allowing implementers 
freedom to use native operating system API's for actual implementations.</p>
<h3>Requirements on implementations</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, all Filesystem Library member and non-member 
functions meet the following common requirements.</p>
<h4>Portable Behavior</h4>
<p>Implementations are encouraged, but not required, to provide behavior as 
specified for each Boost.Filesystem function. If the specified behavior is not 
provided, an implementation shall document the actual behavior provided.</p>
<p><b>Rationale:</b> Portable behavior is strongly encouraged, since this is a 
key objective of the library.&nbsp; It is not required because in some environments 
portable behavior is impossible or unreasonably difficult to implement. The 
documentation requirement allows users to be aware of potential portability 
problems.</p>
<h4>Graceful degradation</h4>
<p>Filesystem Library functions which cannot 
be fully supported on a particular operating system will be partially supported 
if possible. Implementations must document such partial support. Functions which 
are requested to provide some operation which they cannot support should report 
an error at compile time (preferred) or throw an exception at runtime.</p>
<p>For environments not supporting file systems with hierarchical directory 
structures Boost.Filesystem headers shall fail to compile.</p>
<p>If no file systems with hierarchical directory structures are available at 
runtime, all Boost.Filesystem functions shall throw a basic_filesystem_error&lt;path&gt; 
exception.</p>
<p>If a Boost.Filesystem component depends on file system functionality not 
available in the current environment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Safe fallback behavior must be provided if possible.</li>
  <li>Otherwise a basic_filesystem_error exception is thrown.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Rationale:</b> Although the Boost.Filesystem implement runs on POSIX or 
Windows, the above guidance is provided for implementations on operating systems 
which can be supported only partially or not at all. Implementations on 
less-powerful operating systems should provide useful functionality if possible, 
but are not be required to simulate features not present in the underlying 
operating system.</p>
<h4><b>Postconditions not guaranteed in the presence of race-conditions</b></h4>
<p>Filesystem function specifications follow the form of C++ Standard Library 
specifications, and so sometimes specify behavior in terms of postconditions. If 
a <a href="#Race-condition">race-condition</a> exists, a function's 
postconditions may no longer be true by the time the function returns to the 
caller.</p>
<h4><b>May throw exceptions</b></h4>
<p>Filesystem Library functions throw <i>
<a href="exception.htm">basic_filesystem_error</a></i> 
exceptions if they cannot successfully complete their operational 
specifications. Also, implementations may use C++ Standard Library functions, 
which may throw <i>std::bad_alloc</i>. These exceptions may be thrown even 
though the error condition leading to the exception is not explicitly specified 
in the function's &quot;Throws&quot; paragraph.</p>
<p>All exceptions thrown by the Filesystem 
Library are implemented by calling <a href="../../utility/throw_exception.html">
boost::throw_exception()</a>. Thus exact behavior may differ depending on 
BOOST_NO_EXCEPTIONS at the time the filesystem source files are compiled.</p>
<h4>Symbolic and hard links</h4>
<p><a name="link_rules">Links follow operating system rules</a>- <a href="#link">Links</a> are 
transparent in that Filesystem Library functions simply follow operating system 
rules. That implies that some functions may throw <i><a href="exception.htm">
basic_filesystem_error</a></i> 
exceptions if a link is cyclic or has other problems. Also, see an important
<a href="operations.htm#symbolic-link-warning">symbolic links warning</a>.</p>
<p>Typical operating systems rules call for deep operations on all links except 
that destructive operations on non-reference counted links are either shallow, 
or fail altogether in the case of trying to remove a non-reference counted link 
to a directory.</p>
<p><b>Rationale:</b> Follows existing practice (POSIX, Windows, etc.).</p>
<h4><b>No atomic-operation or rollback guarantee</b></h4>
<p>Filesystem Library 
functions which throw exceptions may leave the external file system in an 
altered state. It is suggested that implementations provide stronger guarantees 
when reasonable.</p>
<p><b>Rationale:</b> Implementers shouldn't be required to provide guarantees which are 
impossible to meet on some operating systems. Implementers are given 
normative encouragement to provide those guarantees when reasonable.</p>
<h2><a name="Race-condition">Race-condition</a> d<a name="Dangers">anger</a></h2>
<p>The state of files and directories is often
globally shared, and thus may be changed unexpectedly by other threads, 
processes, or even other computers having network access to the filesystem. As an 
example of the difficulties this can cause, note that the following asserts 
may fail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>assert( exists( &quot;foo&quot; ) == exists( &quot;foo&quot; ) );&nbsp; // 
(1)<br>
<br>
remove_all( &quot;foo&quot; );<br>
assert( !exists( &quot;foo&quot; ) );&nbsp; // (2)<br>
<br>
assert( is_directory( &quot;foo&quot; ) == is_directory( &quot;foo&quot; ) ); // 
(3)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(1) will fail if a non-existent &quot;foo&quot; comes into existence, or an 
existent &quot;foo&quot; is removed, between the first and second call to <i>exists()</i>. 
This could happen if, during the execution of the example code, another thread, 
process, or computer is also performing operations in the same directory.</p>
<p>(2) will fail if between the call to <i>remove_all()</i> and the call to
<i>exists()</i> a new file or directory named &quot;foo&quot; is created by another 
thread, process, or computer.</p>
<p>(3) will fail if another thread, process, or computer removes an 
existing file &quot;foo&quot; and then creates a directory named &quot;foo&quot;, between the 
example code's two calls to <i>is_directory()</i>.</p>
<p>A program which needs to be robust when operating on potentially-shared file 
or directory resources should be prepared for <i>filesystem_error</i> exceptions 
to be thrown from any filesystem function except those explicitly specified as 
not throwing exceptions.</p>
<h2><a name="Implementation">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>The current implementation supports operating systems which provide 
either the POSIX or Windows API.</p>

</ul>
<p>The library is in regular use on Apple  OS X, HP-UX, IBM AIX, Linux, 
Microsoft Windows, SGI IRIX, and Sun Solaris operating systems using a variety 
of compilers.</p>
<h2><a name="narrow-only">Restricting library to narrow character paths</a></h2>
<p>Compilers or standard libraries which do not support wide characters (wchar_t) 
or wide character strings (std::wstring) are detected automatically, and cause 
the library to compile code that is restricted to narrow character paths 
(boost::filesystem::path). Users can force this restriction by defining the 
macro BOOST_FILESYSTEM_NARROW_ONLY. That may be useful for dealing with legacy 
compilers or operating systems.</p>
<h2><a name="Building">Building</a> the object-library</h2>
<p>The object-library will normally be built automatically. See
<a href="../../../more/getting_started.html">Getting Started</a>. It can also be 
built manually using a <a href="../build/Jamfile">Jamfile</a> 
supplied in directory libs/filesystem/build, or the user can construct an IDE 
project or make file which includes the object-library source files.</p>
<p>The object-library source files are 
supplied in directory <a href="../src">libs/filesystem/src</a>. These source files implement the 
library for POSIX or Windows compatible operating systems; no implementation is 
supplied for other operating systems. Note that many operating systems not 
normally thought of as POSIX  systems, such as mainframe legacy 
operating systems or embedded operating systems, support POSIX compatible file 
systems which will work with the Filesystem Library.</p>
<p>The object-library can be built for static or dynamic (shared/dll) linking. 
This is controlled by the BOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK or BOOST_FILESYSTEM_DYN_LINK 
macros. See the <a href="../../../more/separate_compilation.html">Separate 
Compilation</a> page for a description of the techniques used.</p>
<h3>Note for <a name="Cgywin">Cygwin</a> users</h3>
<p>The library's implementation code automatically detects the current platform, 
and compiles the POSIX or Windows implementation code accordingly. Automatic 
platform detection during object library compilation can be overridden by 
defining either BOOST_POSIX_API or BOOST_WINDOWS_API macros. With the exception of the Cygwin 
environment, there is usually no reason to define these macros, as the 
software development kits supplied with most compilers only support a single 
platform.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> package of tools supports 
traditional Windows usage, but also provides an emulation layer and other tools 
which can be used to make Windows act as Linux (and thus POSIX), and provide the 
Linux look-and-feel. GCC is usually the compiler of choice in this environment, 
as it can be installed via the Cygwin install process. Other compilers can also 
use the Cygwin emulation of POSIX, at least in theory.</p>
<p>Those wishing to use the Cygwin POSIX emulation layer should define the 
BOOST_POSIX_API macro when compiling bother user programs and the 
Boost.Filesystem's object-library.</p>

<p>A lengthy discussion on the C++ committee's library reflector illuminated the &quot;illusion 
of portability&quot; problem, particularly in postings by PJ Plauger and Pete Becker.</p>

<p>Walter Landry provided much help illuminating symbolic link use cases for 
version 1.31.0.</p>

<h2><a name="Change-history">Change history</a></h2>

<h3>Version 1.34.0</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="i18n.htm#Internationalization">Internationalization</a>, provided by 
  class templates <i>basic_path</i>, <i>basic_filesystem_error</i>, and <i>
  basic_directory_iterator</i>.</li>
  <li><a href="i18n.htm#Simplification">Simplification</a> of the path interface, 
  including elimination of distinction between native and generic formats, 
  and separation of name checking functionality from general path functionality.</li>
  <li><a href="i18n.html#Rationalization">Rationalization</a> of predicate 
  function design, including the addition of several new functions.</li>
  <li><a href="i18n.htm#Preservation">Preservation</a> of existing user code whenever 
  possible. Deprecated features (<i>symbolic_link_exists()</i>, etc.) remain 
  available for legacy code.</li>
  <li>Clearer specification, by reference to [<a href="design.htm#POSIX-01">POSIX-01</a>], 
  the ISO/IEEE Single Unix Standard, with provisions for Windows and other 
  operating systems.</li>
  <li>New functions
  <a href="operations.htm#status">status</a>,
  <a href="operations.htm#symlink_status">symlink_status</a>,
  <a href="operations.htm#is_file">is_file</a>,
  <a href="operations.htm#is_symlink">is_symlink</a>, <a href="operations.htm#create_hard_link">create_hard_link</a>.</li>
  <li>Separation within the implementation of the distinction between the native 
  operating system path syntax and API. This is important for CYGWIN users 
  because it allows them to build for either the Windows or POSIX API's.</li>
  <li>Numerous small implementation fixes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.33.0</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Some small implementation fixes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.32.0</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="operations.htm#file_size">file_size()</a> function added.</li>
  <li>Class path <a href="path.htm#operator_eq">relational operators</a> added.</li>
  <li><a href="operations.htm#equivalent">equivalent()</a> function added.</li>
  <li><a href="operations.htm#create_directory">create_directory()</a> no longer 
  throws if the directory already exists. A bool is returned, indicating that 
  the directory did not preexist. Similar changes made to
  <a href="convenience.htm">create_directories()</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="#Cgywin">Docs added</a> for users wishing Cygwin/POSIX behavior 
  on Windows.</li>
  <li>For POSIX, Large File Support (LSF) is enabled if available, such as on 
  Linux.</li>
  <li><a href="operations.htm#current_path">current_path()</a> and
  <a href="operations.htm#initial_path">initial_path()</a> on POSIX now handle 
  very long paths correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.31.0</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The object library can now be <a href="#Building">built</a> for either 
  static or dynamic (shared/dll) linking. </li>
  <li>Several added functions, including improved checking for directory and 
  file name portability. See <a href="path.htm#default_name_check">Default name 
  check functions</a>, <a href="path.htm#name_check­_mechanism">Default name 
  check mechanism</a>, and <a href="portability_guide.htm#name_check­_functions">
  Name check functions</a>.</li>
  <li>Separation of <a href="path.htm#Canonical">Canonical form</a> and
  <a href="path.htm#Normalized">Normalized form</a> and a new path member 
  function <a href="path.htm#normalize">normalize()</a>. This changes behavior, 
  in that canonical form is now different, but eliminates a subtle
  <a href="design.htm#symbolic-link-use-case">bug</a> when symbolic links to 
  directories are present. </li>
</ul>
