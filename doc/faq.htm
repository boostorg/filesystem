FAQ</h1>
<p><b>Why not use a URI (Universal Resource Identifier) based path?</b></p>
<p>URI's would promise more than the Filesystem Library can actually deliver, 
since URI's extend far beyond what most operating systems consider a file or a 
directory.&nbsp; Thus for the primary &quot;portable script-style file system 
operations&quot; requirement of the Filesystem Library, full URI's appear to be over-specification.</p>
<p><b>Why base the generic-path string format on POSIX?<br>
<br>
</b>POSIX is the basis for the most familiar path-string formats, including the 
URL portion of URI's and the native Windows format. It is ubiquitous and 
familiar.&nbsp; On many systems, it is very easy to implement because it is 
either the native operating system format (Unix and Windows) or via a 
operating system supplied 
POSIX library (z/OS, OS/390, and many more.)</p>
<p><b>Why isn't <i>path</i> a base class with derived <i>directory_path</i> and
<i>file_path</i> classes?</b></p>
<p>Why bother?&nbsp; The behavior of all three classes is essentially identical. 
Several early versions did require users to identify each path as a file or 
directory path, and this seemed to increase errors and decrease code 
readability. There was no apparent upside benefit. </p>
<p><b>Why not support a  concept of specific kinds file systems, such as 
posix_file_system or windows_file_system.</b></p>
<p>Portability is one of the one or two most important requirements for the 
library.&nbsp; Gaining some advantage by using features specific to particular 
operating systems is not a requirement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, concepts like &quot;posix_file_system&quot; 
are very slippery. What happens when a NTFS or ISO 9660 file system is mounted 
in directory on a machine running the POSIX operating system, for example?</p>
<p><b>Why not supply a 'handle' type, and let the file and directory operations 
traffic in it?</b></p>
<p>It isn't clear there is any feasible way to meet the &quot;portable script-style 
file system operations&quot; requirement with such a system. File systems exist where operations are usually performed on 
  some non-string handle type. The classic Mac OS has been mentioned explicitly as a case where 
trafficking in paths isn't always natural.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The case for the &quot;handle&quot; (opaque data type to identify a file) 
style may be strongest for directory iterator value type.&nbsp; (See Jesse Jones' Jan 28, 
2002, Boost postings). However, as class path has evolved, it seems sufficient 
even as the directory iterator value type.</p>
<p><b>Why aren't directories considered to be files?</b></p>
<p>Because 
directories cannot portably and usefully be opened as files using the C++ Standard Library stdio or fstream 
I/O facilities. An important additional rationale is that separating the concept 
of directories and files makes exposition and specification clearer. A 
particular problem is the naming and description of function arguments.</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td colspan="3">
      <p align="center"><b>Meaningful Names for Arguments</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Argument Intent</b></td>
      <td><b>Meaningful name if<br>
      directories are files</b></td>
      <td><b>Meaningful name if<br>
      directories aren't files</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A path to either a directory or a non-directory</td>
      <td align="center"><i>path</i></td>
      <td align="center"><i>path</i></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A path to a directory, but not to a non-directory</td>
      <td align="center"><i>directory_path</i></td>
      <td align="center"><i>directory_path</i></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A path to a non-directory, but not a directory</td>
      <td align="center"><i>non_directory_path</i></td>
      <td align="center"><i>file_path</i></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>The problem is that when directories are considered files, <i>
non_directory_path</i> as an argument name, and the corresponding &quot;non-directory 
path&quot; in documentation, is ugly and lengthy, and so is shortened to just <i>path</i>, 
causing the code and documentation to be confusing if not downright wrong. The 
names which result from the &quot;directories aren't files&quot; approach are more 
acceptable and less likely to be used incorrectly. </p>
<p><b>Why are the operations.hpp non-member functions so low-level?</b></p>
<p>To provide a toolkit from which higher-level functionality can be created.</p>
<p>An 
extended attempt to add convenience functions on top of, or as a replacement 
for, the low-level functionality failed because there is no widely acceptable 
set of simple semantics for most convenience functions considered.&nbsp; 
Attempts to provide alternate semantics, via either run-time options or 
compile-time polices, became overly complicated in relation to the value 
delivered, or became contentious.&nbsp; OTOH, the specific functionality needed for several trial 
applications was very easy for the user to construct from the lower-level 
toolkit functions.&nbsp; See <a href="#Failed Attempts">Failed Attempts</a>.</p>
<p><b>Isn't it inconsistent then to provide a few convenience functions?</b></p>
<p>Yes, but experience with both this library, POSIX, and Windows indicates 
the utility of certain convenience functions, and that it is possible to provide 
simple, yet widely acceptable, semantics for them. For example, remove_all.</p>
<p><b>Why are library functions so picky about errors?</b></p>
<p>Safety. The default is to be safe rather than sorry. This is particularly 
important given the reality that on many computer systems files and directories 
are <a href="#global">globally shared</a> resources .</p>
<p><b>Why are errors reported by exception rather than return code or error 
notification variable?</b></p>
<p>Safety.&nbsp;Return codes or error notification variables are often ignored 
by programmers.&nbsp; Exceptions are much harder to ignore, provided desired 
default behavior (program termination) if not caught, yet allow error recovery 
if desired.</p>
<p><b>Why are attributes accessed via named functions rather than property maps?</b></p>
<p>For a few commonly used attributes (existence, directory or file, emptiness), 
simple syntax and guaranteed presence outweigh other considerations. Because 
access to virtually all other attributes is inherently system dependent, 
property maps are viewed as the best hope for access and modification, but it is 
better design to provide such functionality in a separate library. (Historical 
note: even the apparently simple attribute &quot;read-only&quot; turned out to be so 
system depend as to be disqualified as a &quot;guaranteed presence&quot; operation.)</p>
<p><b>Why isn't there a set_current_directory function?</b></p>
<p>Global variables are considered harmful [<a href="design.htm#Wulf-Shaw-73">wulf-shaw-73</a>]. 
While we can't prevent people from shooting themselves in the foot, we aren't 
about to hand them the gun.</p>
<p><b>Why aren't there query functions for compound conditions like existing_directory?</b></p>
<p>After several attempts, named queries for multi-attribute proved a 
slippery-slope; where do you stop?</p>
<p><b>Why aren't <a name="wide-character names">wide-character names</a> supported? Why not std::wstring or even 
a templated type?</b></p>
<p>Wide-character names would provide an illusion of portability where 
portability does not in fact exist. Behavior would be completely different on 
operating systems (Windows, for example) that support wide-character names, than 
on systems which don't (POSIX). Providing functionality that appears to provide 
portability but in fact delivers only implementation-defined behavior is highly 
undesirable. Programs would not even be portable between library implementations 
on the same operating system, let alone portable to different operating systems.</p>
<p>The C++ standards committee Library Working Group discussed this in some 
detail both on the committee's library reflector and at the Spring, 2002, <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;meeting</font>, and feels that (1) names based on types other than char are 
extremely non-portable, (2) there are no agreed upon semantics for conversion 
between wide-character and narrow-character names for file systems which do not support 
wide-character name, and 
(3) even the committee members most interested in wide-character names are 
unsure that they are a good idea in the context of a portable library.</p>
<p><b>Why aren't file and directory name portability errors detected automatically, 
rather than by separate function calls?</b></p>
<p>Applications mix use of portable and non-portable names, and the situations 
where non-portable names constitute errors vary widely.&nbsp; For example, a 
non-portable name found by a <i>directory_iterator</i> may or may not constitute 
an application error. In another example, for an application copying selected 
native directories and files for later use restricted to ISO-6990 filesystem, 
conditions for error are very different between the source and the target.</p>
<p>A number (at least six) of designs for automatic name validity error 
detection were evaluated, including at least four complete implementations.&nbsp; 
While the details for rejection differed, they all tended to distort the 
otherwise simple design of the rest of the library.</p>
<p><b>Why doesn't the generic path grammar include syntax for portably 
specifying the root directory?</b></p>
<p>The concept of &quot;root directory&quot; appears to be inherently non-portable.&nbsp; 
For example, &quot;/&quot;&nbsp; means one thing on POSIX (an absolute path the single 
filesystem root), and another on Windows (a relative path to the root of the 
current drive).&nbsp; It goes rapidly downhill from there; on the classic Mac 
OS, root names can be ambiguous!</p>
<p><b>Why isn't there a path::is_absolute() or similar function?</b></p>
<p>Because useful semantics are not obvious. On some operating systems a path is clearly either absolute or 
relative, but on others the distinction isn't clear. For example, on Windows consider these 
paths:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;/foo&quot; is not strictly an absolute path since it is relative to the 
  current drive, yet appending it to another path as if it were relative clearly 
  isn't correct.</li>
  <li>&quot;c:foo&quot; is relative to the current working directory on drive &quot;c:&quot;, 
  yet it can't be treated like other relative paths in that it can't be appended 
  to an absolute path.</li>
</ul>
